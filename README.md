# Oculus-Navigator
#This project's purpose is to navigate the UI through gestures like they do in Sci-Fi movies.
#Suggested to use a virtual environment but can also be run normally.
#The modules required are mentioned in the requirement.txt file.
#There are stages of this project :-
  1. Version-1 is only testing program whether the hands are recognised or not.
  2. Version-2 isn't present due to some reasons although its not required.
  3. Version-3 focuses on the gesture recognition. (Sample gestures are: thumbs_up, palm, yo, call, peace, etc)
  4. Version-4 is the more accurate version of version-3.
  5. Version-5 finally implements the UI controls using the pyautogui module.
  6. Further improvement is still under progress.
