# Oculus-Navigator
#This project's purpose is to navigate the UI through gestures like they do in Sci-Fi movies.
Suggested to use a virtual environment but can also be run normally.
The modules required are mentioned in the **requirement.txt** file.
These are stages of this project :-
  1. **Version-1** is only testing program whether the hands are recognised or not.
  2. **Version-2** isn't present due to some reasons although its not required.
  3. **Version-3** focuses on the gesture recognition. (Sample gestures are: thumbs_up, palm, yo, call, peace, etc)
  4. **Version-4** is the more accurate version of version-3.
  5. **Version-5** finally implements the UI controls using the _pyautogui_ module.
  6. _Further improvement is still under progress._
Don't forget to read the **do_not_ignore.txt** file
